Basic URL-Shortening app written in node.js, express and redis.

The code is very sloppy (a n00b, I am) so input is greatly appreciated.


DEPENDENCIES:

node.js
express
jade
stylus
nib
redis

INSTALLATION:

1)  Download github repo
2)  Download dependencies 'npm install node.js express jade stylus nib redis'
3)  Run 'node app.js'
    note:  the app assumes you are able to run off of low-numbered ports.  If you are not able to do so, please change 'app.listen(80)' to 'app.listen(yourPortHere')

Enjoy!
