Basic URL-Shortening app written in node.js, express and redis.

The code is very sloppy (a n00b, I am) so input is greatly appreciated.


DEPENDENCIES:

node.js
express
jade
stylus
nib
redis

INSTALLATION:

1)  Download and compile latest version of node.js
    note:  instructions here (https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)
2)  Install npm 'curl http://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh'
    note:  if you don't have curl installed, curl installation instructions are here (http://curl.haxx.se/docs/install.html)
3)  Download github repo
4)  Download dependencies 'npm install express jade stylus nib redis'
5)  Run 'node app.js'
    note:  the app assumes you are able to run off of low-numbered ports.  If you are not able to do so, please change 'app.listen(80)' to 'app.listen(yourPortHere')

Enjoy!
